# House Rentals Website (Angular)

This is my first Angular app, a simple web application for finding and listing houses for rent. This README file provides an overview of the project, its features, and instructions on how to set it up and use it.


## Features

- List houses for rent.
- Search and filter houses by location.
- View details of each house, including images, descriptions, and contact information.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer.
- [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) installed globally.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
